1. A custom security module used to secure all apps
	- Every app that needs security should have petstore security in its class path and @EnablePetstoreSecurity is used in the SpringApplication.
	- Every app that uses this module becomes a secure resource server and any unauthenticated request to the app is redirected to /login page which is inside this module.
	- to authenticate with auth srver

2. Config Server (Externalizing configuration). We have mix and match of config server and user defined services for demo.
	- Secured by basic auth
	- Config server has git uri in its yml. (https://github.com/jaswalkiranavtar/pet-store-config-repo)
	- Each component has the uri of config server in its yml, which comes from config-service cups.
	- Config server gets refreshed when the property is updated, however to refresh the property in app, use RefreshBean and hit /env actuator endpoint.
	
3. 2 Discovery servers: 
	- Each App registers to the cluster and 2 instances registers to each other. 
	- Any component should be bound to CUPS discovery-service to register itself with eureka.

4. Auth Server:
	- Has properties coming from both cups and config server. 
	- Has /oauth/authorize and /oauth/token endpoints. 
	- Accounts and creds are in property files.
	- Symmetric key is used to sign jwt token.
	- Has clientId, clientSecret, grantTypes, scopes
	
5. 	Data service:
	- In meory H2
	- Uses spring data jpa repositories that gives crud repositories out of box.
	- Secured by petstore security
	- Has endpoints to read, write and delete pets.
	- Bounds config, discovery and sso cups.
	
6. UI:
	- Hosts angular app and Zuul reverse proxy and user endpoint.
	- Secured By petstore security
	- Used maven plugin to build UI.
	- Bounds config, discovery and sso cups.
	
7. One click run and build scripts.

8. Entire suite of apps is structured as multimodule project and maven reactor can build the app issuing mvn package command in petstore root.

9. All the logs are in logs directory.	

10. Blue/Green Deployment

11. Material Design and Angular 4 [Has dialog, Snackbar and role based authorization]

12. API tests using rest assured.
